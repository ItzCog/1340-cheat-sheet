# ENGG1340 Cheat Sheet by Cog

This is a cheat sheet made by Ma "Cog" Yuanche and dedicated for use in ENGG1340 exam. It is designed to be compact,
containing the most difficult-to-remember knowledge points, and should fit in two sides of one A4 paper.

## Contents

So far, this sheet covers the following aspects of this course:

- A good amount of portion for Bash scripting, including some advanced tools, syntax and techniques.

I have decided not to add the basics for C++ part. This is because C++ basics are relatively easy to memorize,
especially with you already having learned Python first. On the other hand, Bash scripting syntax does not have so much
common with Python (or any other programming language I know about) so there is much more things to memorize.

I might consider adding in more advanced points about C++ in the future.

More content will be added as the course progresses.

## Disclaimer

This sheet is not supposed to be a 100% full coverage of everything in this course. I expect the users of this sheet to
manage to remember most of the stuff, and only use this sheet as an add-on for the small but important details. This
means you should remember things like how to write if-statements, loops, and even more complex things like the usage of
`chmod`, if you want this sheet to work for you.

This sheet is a reinforcement, not a substitute for the lecture PPTs and your own learning process. Using this sheet in
the exam without prior studying, or using this sheet as the only learning material does not guarantee any improvements
for your score.

This sheet's content selection is based on my personal experiences and might not be suitable for everyone. The format
of this sheet is not standardized and might not make sense to everyone.

This sheet is not guaranteed to be 100% accurate. I will try to make it as precise as possible, and I also welcome
anyone to point out any mistakes or give any suggestions, but I still can't promise that this cheat sheet will be 
perfect in the end. I cannot be responsible for any score deduction caused by any mistake or inaccuracy I have made.

This sheet is designed to prefer compactness to readability. Fitting an entire course into one sheet of A4 paper is a 
challenging task, even when I only select a small portion of it. The primary purpose of the sheet's layout is making
sure that there's space for everything, and consequently some parts becomes harder to read. If you have adequate
knowledge about HTML and CSS, you can consider making some edits to improve readability before printing it out.
